# scripts

I've made a script to check if Radarr is missing a defined [audioLanguage] (media analysis required). It will also define movies based on their original language at release (tmdb api required). You can choose to delete only movies released in [audioLanguage] and missing it(will catch movies with unknown audio), or delete those and movies released in another language and missing the defined [audioLanguage].

Please take a look and any feedback is appreciated. This script will not delete anything at the moment as the commands to do that are missing! It is safe to use, though disclaimer - I made it ;)
